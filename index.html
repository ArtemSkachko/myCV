        <p>Hi, my name is Artem, I’m 31, and I have come a long way. First of all, I was born and raised in Ukraine, the
            city of Donetsk. My first specialization is accounting and auditing. In this area, I held the positions of a
            bank clerk, assistant accountant, and auditor. At the moment I have valid qualification certificates as an
            expert appraiser and bankruptcy manager. For the past 7 years, design has been my hobby and an additional
            source of income. I really like it and I decided to make design my main craft. I have been working with
            Remote Helpers for more than a year, in position of a designer, a project manager, sometimes helping in
            legal and accounting field. In the field of design, I also have quite a lot of experience. This is a design
            of any printing products, outdoor advertising, branding, as well as a web design from social networks to
            corporate sites and the development of complex interfaces and systems. I am constantly evolving and right
            now getting a front end developing specialization. I can’t fully list the technologies and skills that I
            own, because it will take a lot of time. Of the main ones, one can single out work with any raster and
            vector graphics, create wireframes, layouts, transfer them to HTML, CSS, and java script code, and much
            more. I am very attentive to details, following the trends, using the latest technologies, and trying to
            achieve the most ideal results in everything that I do. These traits helped me to became a Head of Front-end
            developers. Well, how can I help you? You decide. Now you know how to find me. Bye!</p>
